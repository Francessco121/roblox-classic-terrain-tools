# Custom 2014 Roblox Studio Terrain Plugins
Custom plugins to be installed in the `BuiltInPlugins\terrain` folder in a 2014 (or similar) build of Roblox Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> When installed, these plugins will show up under the `Terrain` ribbonbar tab in Studio and not the `Plugins` tab.

## Plugins
- `Builder+` - Enhanced version of the `Builder` plugin that allows you to click and drag to build boxes of voxels instead of just one at a time. Additionally, you can use the hotkeys `R` and `T` to change the orientation and type of the voxel being placed.
- `Remover+` - Enhanced version of the `Remover` plugin that allows you to click and drag to remove boxes of voxels instead of just one at a time.
- `Wall Brush` - Modified version of the `Brush` plugin that extends drawn terrain all the way down to Y = 1. This avoids gaps below drawn terrain when drawing on top of hills/slopes.

## Disclaimer
Most of the code in these plugins is owned by Roblox. These plugins are modified versions of existing plugins that ship with 2014 builds of Roblox Studio.
