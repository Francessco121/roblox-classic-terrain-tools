# Classic Terrain Textures for Studio 2014+
The 2014 builds of Roblox Studio use different textures for classic voxel terrain. If you are using 2014 studio to create terrain to be imported into newer versions of Roblox but with the original textures, this can be a bit awkward as the terrain will look very different before import. The textures in your installation of 2014 studio can be replaced with the textures in this folder to *mostly* restore the terrain to the original look.

## Installation
In a 2014 installation of Roblox Studio, there's the folder `PlatformContent\pc\textures\terrain`. Make a backup of the `.dds` files in this folder and then replace them with the `.dds` files from this folder.
